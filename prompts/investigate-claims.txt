## QUESTIONS

Let's first determine what the patient ID is. There's likely going to be a few fields in this table with patient information, such as date of birth (DOB) or zip code. There might also be ID-looking fields like the social security number (SSN) or medicare beneficiary identifier (MBI). These are all important and we'll want to capture them, but there is typically another field, sometimes called member_id on claims files, that is the internal autogenerated ID.

Next let's find the date of service field, and the procedure code. Note the date mask format of the date of service field, we'll need to know that later. The procedure code is typically a HCPCS code.

Next let's start to figure out the transaction ID, the claim ID, and the service line item number. This part can be tricky! Typically each claim will have several line items which are charged independently. This file might have multiple rows per claim + line item, because this data is often transactional. That is to say, adjustments and reversals come over in different rows, and we'll eventually need to reconcile them down to a "final-action" standard. To do that, we need to understand how these transactions work.

We're going to use the patient ID, the date of service, and the procedure code that we've just identified. These fields together constitute a sort of natural key for the claim, and will help us understand the transactionality of the claim, which will help us understand what kind of world we're living in with this file. 

Let's just look at 50 rows, sorted by patient ID, then date of service, then procedure code, then claim ID, then line number (which you should cast to a float). Include all these fields, as well as the amount paid, the transaction/report date, as well as any other fields that seem relevant.

Some questions to answer are: is the field that we believe to be the claim ID actually the claim ID? If it changes with every transaction, then maybe it's more of a transaction ID, even if it's labeled claim_number or suchlike. Are there multiple transactions per service line item? If so, how can we construct a transaction ID (generally you can use claim ID + line number + transaction/report date)? If the data are not transactional, then we don't need a transaction ID and will leave it null.

*****

If the data is transactional, there are two main standards: restated or incremental. For example if a claim originally comes over for 100.00 and is later revised to 80.00, a restated-style standard will simply send another row of data with 80.00. On the other hand, an incremental-style standard will send a -20.00, or possibly a -100.00 followed by an 80.00. What standard are we using here? The presence of negative numbers in the paid amount tends to indicate an incremental standard.

That said, sometimes the data is buggy or poorly formed. Sometimes the source data simply repeats the lines with every update, sending the exact same amounts paid many times. This isn't great but we can treat it with the "restated" standard. It's worth interrogating the data to see if the transactions reliably "make sense" given our assumption.

Let's challenge our hypothesis about the transaction ID by executing some queries that span the entire data set, instead of just looking at the first few rows.

```
-- proves that claim number + service line number + transaction date is a primary key
-- and therefore that the table has no pure duplicates
select count(*) as should_be_zero 
from (
  select clm_id, min(clm_pmt_amt), max(clm_pmt_amt)
  from my_claims_table
  group by clm_id, service_line_number, transaction_date
  having count(*) > 1
) subquery;
```

```
-- proves that even if claim number + service line number + transaction date is not a primary key,
-- any rows that share these three fields are pure duplicates
select count(*) as should_be_zero 
from (
  select clm_id, min(clm_pmt_amt), max(clm_pmt_amt)
  from my_claims_table
  group by clm_id, service_line_number, transaction_date
  having min(paid_amt) <> max(paid_amt)
) subquery;
```

How do we determine which rows are professional claims and which rows are institutional claims? Sometimes professional claims and institutional claims are kept in separate source data tables, in which case all of the records on this table maybe one type or the other. But often these claims are intermingled in a table, and each row is either one or the other. 

There is often a claim type code with values such as 'I' and 'P'. Alternatively, type of bill codes are only on institutional claims, whereas facility type codes are only on professional claims. If both of these indicators are in place, make sure that they harmonize with each other. For example,

```
select distinct claim_type_code
from my_claims_table
limit 20 -- just in case there are an unexpectedly large number of distinct claim type codes

-- proves that the claim_type_code of I (for institutional) never has a facility type code
select count(*) as should_be_zero 
from my_claims_table
where claim_type_code = 'I'
and fac_type_code is not null
and fac_type_code not like ''

-- proves that the claim_type_code of P (for professional) never has a type of bill code
select count(*) as should_be_zero 
from my_claims_table
where claim_type_code = 'P'
and bill_type_code is not null
and bill_type_code not like ''
```

What is the function of all the dollar amount fields in the table, and the relationship between the dollar amount fields and the claim grain size? Which columns represent the header-level amount, and which are line-item amounts? Do the line item amounts sum to the header amounts across all the claim IDs?

For example, queries such as the following:

```
-- proves that clm_pmt_amt never varies within a clm_id
select count(*) as should_be_zero 
from (
  select clm_id, min(clm_pmt_amt), max(clm_pmt_amt)
  from my_claims_table
  group by clm_id
  having min(clm_pmt_amt) <> max(clm_pmt_amt)
) subquery;
```

and 

```
-- proves that line_prvdr_pmt_amt always rolls up at the header level to equal clm_pmt_amt
select count(*) as should_be_zero 
from (
  select clm_id, sum(cast(line_prvdr_pmt_amt as decimal(18, 2))), max(cast(clm_pmt_amt as decimal(18, 2))) 
  from my_claims_table
  group by clm_id
  having sum(cast(line_prvdr_pmt_amt as decimal(18, 2))) <> max(cast(clm_pmt_amt as decimal(18, 2)))
) subquery;
```

and 

```
-- proves that line_prvdr_pmt_amt and line_nch_pmt_amt are perfectly redundant
select count(*) as should_be_zero 
from (
  select clm_id, line_prvdr_pmt_amt, line_nch_pmt_amt
  from my_claims_table
  where line_prvdr_pmt_amt <> line_nch_pmt_amt
) subquery;
```

could help establish a relationship that clm_id represents the claim header ID, and that line_prvdr_pmt_amt is the line item amount that always rolls up the the header amount of clm_pmt_amt.

There are often multiple sets of payment amounts, such as might represent the allowed amount (which is the negotiated amount that is typically the actual amount paid) versus the charge amount (which is the sticker price, typically more than is actually paid). We want to understand the function and relationship of every amount field in the table.

It is not sufficient to guess at the relationship of the fields by looking at several columns with a LIMIT in place, although that often works for the start of your investigation. Each insight should be definitively confirmed using the sorts of examples in the above queries, which ensure that there are 0 rows that violate the expectations you've arrived upon.

This will probably require you to make a dozen or more queries, depending on the number of dollar amount columns in the table.

What does each record represent? It is not sufficient to just say "medical claim". Is it part of a professional, institutional, or pharmacy claim? Is it the claim header or is each row a line-item detail?

What are the fields for the billing provider and service provider?

As background: provider can mean an indidual physician or a provider organization. NPI is a national registry used to identify both individual physicians and/or provider organizations. 

The billing provider should be defined as the provider, often an organization, that's getting paid for the services. The service provider, on the other hand, should be the physician that's providing the services. 

However, sometimes the billing provider is labeled in the source data to be the individual clinician who is listed on the bill as the service provider. This often happens when there is an attending physician who is overseeing the patient's care when the patient is actually being seen by a resident. In this case, the resident might be labeled as the service provider and the attending physician might be labeled as the billing provider, but we don't think of it that way and would want to correct the labels. One indication that the providers might be mislabeled in this way is if there is another field for "Billing TIN" (the tax ID number, which is almost always an organization), which would then represent what we consider the service provider. Another such indication would be that there are a large number of providers labeled "service provider" in a context where we would expect only a small number of provider organizations to be billing.

So, make sure to identify all fields that are provider IDs, NPIs, or TINs. Look at the distinct count of billing providers versus service providers. Try to determine which field represents our concept of a billing provider, and which represents our concept of a service provider.

What special characters or strings are used to denote missing data (or other special concepts)? Make sure to check every date field for out-of-range values that are clearly placeholders (you can do this by looking at the max and min value of all the date fields).

For each column containing coded values, what are interpretations for each code? For example, are there ICD-10 diagnosis codes? ICD-10 procedure codes? HCPCS codes?
