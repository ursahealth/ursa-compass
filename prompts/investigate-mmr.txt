## QUESTIONS

The key date fields in MMR files are the payment date and the adjustment start and end dates. A run date is often present as well, which if present is typically a few weeks before the payment date. 

The adjustment start and end dates define the period being reported on. This data is typically transactional, and the payment and run dates represent this transactionality. In other words, CMS is contantly updating and adjusting the same historical periods it has already reported on, when new information such as an updated RAF score prompts an alteration to the payment. As a result, the same adjustment start date should have several records, each with different payment dates. Conversely, a single payment date for a member/plan will generally state or restate many periods.

The span between the adjustment start and end dates is often a month, but most MMR files have some periods of longer duration, such as a six-month span. Sometimes the file has been pre-processed to chunk up all the periods into one-month chunks. In this circumstance the adjustment end date is sometimes omitted from the data feed, because it is assumed to be exactly a month after the adjustment start date.

Another way to check if the data has been chunked into months is to sort by patient + period start date + payment date, make sure that there are some >1 month periods that haven't been chunked.

Which of these four fields are present, and does the data look to have been pre-chunked into months?

Another key question is to determine if the data is restated or incremental. Incremental means that every month, say, they give us the last month's transactions. Restated means that every month they do a select *, or maybe give us the last several months of transactions, so: lots of duplicates. This difference is purely a function of how the plans transmit data to us, not in the way the data is probably represented in the source system.

Restated membership data is tricky to resolve. If this were claims data we have a good way of dealing with it: we'd construct a transaction ID and use it to dedupe pure duplicates. That won't work here, because plans sometimes just delete membership records when they want to clean up errant records of a member. So the fact that the member is missing from the most recent cohort *where we would expect to see them* is vital information. If we were to use the claims-style transaction ID dedupe we'd end up thinking that a previous record were still valid.

It's also the case that getting a real transaction ID is tricky for MMR data. You might expect that the grain size should be something like patient ID + contract number + PBP + adjustment start date + adjustment end date + payment effective date, but even within this grain size you'll see that the part-D-relevant records typically come over in a different row than the part-A-and-B-relevant records. 

That said, we can construct something close to a transaction ID and see how many duplicates there are. Generate a composite key with patient ID + contract number + PBP + adjustment start date + adjustment end date + payment effective date + part A months (or a similar part A field) + part D months (or a similar part D field) + adjustment reason code. 

Look at the data where the count of this composite key is greater than one, sorted by the composite key. Are there a great many rows that look like pure duplicates with only the ingestion date different? It's probably restated data. Are there comparatively few rows given the "count of transaction ID > 1" filter, and these rows aren't really pure duplicates but another administrative quirk in the data such as the D vs A+B breakout? Then it's probably incremental data.

The risk adjusted part A amount and risk adjusted part B amount gives us the final action as of our best knowledge, total amount of revenue associated with the patient's risk adjusted status for part A and part B, which is to say, for for part C. This amount has this special property, which is that if it reconciles to any number other than 0, the patient is still enrolled in that month. This is our indicator that the patient is either still enrolled or has been backed out or zeroed out. These fields are not to be confused this with the part A and part B rate amounts, which are what the payment would be if the RAF score were 1. We'll want to map both sets of fields, and you should be able to use a calculation with the RAF score to double-check that you have them both labeled appropriately.

What are the fields that represent the risk-adjusted part A amount, the risk-adjusted part B amount, the part A rate, and the part B rate?
