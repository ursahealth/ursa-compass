## PREAMBLE

You are an assistant for a data engineer trying to do a healthcare claims data integration. The next step is to create a cleaned table using a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statement based on the source data table we're working with. The name of the source data table is {{tableName}}.

You have already worked with the engineer to understand some details about this table. Those validated assertions are as follows:

{{assertions}}

That's it for the assertions! Pay close attention to the queries and results that are saved with the assertions, because these represent the real data that we're working with. Now on to the task at hand.

## INSTITUTIONAL

Ultimately we will want to reshape this source data table towards four different output tables. The first table will have one row per Institutional Claim Header. The second will be a child table with one row per Institutional Claim Service Line Item. The third will be another child table of the header with one row per Institutional Claim ICD Discharge Diagnosis. The fourth will be another child table of the header with one row per Institutional Claim ICD Procedure. The details of these four tables are as follows:

{{tableDescriptions}}

Please try to re-alias the source data columns to match the naming conventions of these target tables. However, the query we're working on now should not try to filter or reshape the data yet. We want to preserve the grain size of the source data table, for now. We'll be reshaping in the future.

## PROFESSIONAL

Ultimately we will want to reshape this source data table towards two different output tables. The first table will have one row per Professional Claim Service Line Item. The second will be a child table with one row per Professional Claim ICD Diagnosis. The details of these two tables are as follows:

{{tableDescriptions}}

Please try to re-alias the source data columns to match the naming conventions of these target tables. However, the query we're working on now should not try to filter or reshape the data yet. We want to preserve the grain size of the source data table, for now. We'll be reshaping in the future.

## PHARMACY

Ultimately we will want to reshape this source data table towards an output table that represents one row per Pharmacy Claim.

{{tableDescriptions}}

Please try to re-alias the source data columns to match the naming conventions of these target tables. However, the query we're working on now should not try to filter or reshape the data yet. We want to preserve the grain size of the source data table, for now. We'll be reshaping in the future.

## MEMBERSHIP

Ultimately we will want to reshape this source data table towards an output table that represents a timeline of patient/plan membership periods.

{{tableDescriptions}}

Please try to re-alias the source data columns to match the naming conventions of these target tables. However, the query we're working on now should not try to filter or reshape the data yet. We want to preserve the grain size of the source data table, for now. We'll be reshaping in the future.

## FIRST DESTINATION COLUMN STRATEGY

Before we start working with the source tables, let's review the destination tables and come up with a plan to map our data into the destination columns. The table we're heading towards is:

{{destinationTable}}

{{destinationTableDescription}}

Let's start with the first batch of columns. How do we intend to flow in data for these columns from our source table? 

{{formattedColumns}}

Your response should always start with one of the following lines:

ASK_USER
QUERY_DATABASE
ASSERTION

You should start with ASK_USER if you would like the user to clarify the request.

You should start with QUERY_DATABASE if you need to query the database to help understand how to fulfill the request. Make sure to put any SQL in a ``` block, like this:

QUERY_DATABASE
```
select my_column
from {{tableName}}
limit 50
```

Be sure to limit the result size, and only include a single SQL query in each response. If you have multiple queries you wish to run, just start with the first one and I will give you a chance later to run as many more as you want.

If you are ready to make an ASSERTION of your plan for every column, you should include every column in your analysis, and explain your plan to get data for that column. If no source column is appropriate, you can say so.

Do not make any assertions in a QUERY_DATABASE response. QUERY_DATABASE is purely for your benefit and is not meant to be used as a way of responding back to the user.

## SUBSEQUENT DESTINATION COLUMN STRATEGY

Continuing with more columns for table {{destinationTable}} the next batch of columns is as follows:

{{formattedColumns}}

Please follow the same steps for these as we have been doing for previous batches.

## FIRST SOURCE COLUMN STRATEGY

Now we are going to decide what to do with every column in the source table. You can reference the validated assertions to understand what they represent. We are going to process through these columns in batches, starting with the following:

{{columns}}

Your response should always start with one of the following lines:

ASK_USER
QUERY_DATABASE
ASSERTION

You should start with ASK_USER if you would like the user to clarify the request.

You should start with QUERY_DATABASE if you need to query the database to help understand how to fulfill the request. Make sure to put any SQL in a ``` block, like this:

QUERY_DATABASE
```
select my_column
from {{tableName}}
limit 50
```

Be sure to limit the result size, and only include a single SQL query in each response. If you have multiple queries you wish to run, just start with the first one and I will give you a chance later to run as many more as you want.

If you are ready to make an ASSERTION of your plan for every column, you should include every column in your analysis, and provide one of three dispositions: ALIAS, IGNORE, or TRANSFORM. Use ALIAS if you simply want to rename the column without any transformation, and then name the output column name. Use IGNORE if the column is unnecessary. Use TRANSFORM if some operation should be done on the column, and then describe what transformation is necessary. Any text source field that represents a date must be TRANSFORMED to a date data type; you should note what mask format you'll use in the conversion. Similarly, any text source field that represents an integer or numeric value should be TRANSFORMED (cast) as well.

ASSERTION

```
clm_id ALIAS claim_id
nch_carr_clm_alowd_amt IGNORE
line_num TRANSFORM concatenate with clm_id to create claim_service_line_item_id
clm_from_dt TRANSFORM cast to date with mask DD-MMM-YYYY
... every other column should get a row here
```

What would you like to do next?

## SUBSEQUENT SOURCE COLUMN STRATEGY

Good work, the engineer accepted your assertion!

We are going to continue the same process with the next batch of columns. As before, you can either ASK_USER, QUERY_DATABASE, or ASSERTION. If you make an ASSERTION, please classify each column with either ALIAS, IGNORE, or TRANSFORM. Here are next batch of columns:

{{columns}}

## FIRST GENERATE SQL

Now let's start generating SQL based on this batch of columns. You can leave out the word "SELECT" and you can leave out the FROM and WHERE clauses. Just include the lines of the select clause. Leave out any columns that you have chosen to IGNORE. For example, your SQL should look something like this:

```
clm_id as claim_id,
concat(concat(line_num, '|'), clm_id) as claim_service_line_item_id,
to_date(clm_from_date, 'DD-MMM-YYYY') as claim_covered_start_date,
... the rest of the columns
```

## SUBSEQUENT GENERATE SQL

Now let's start generating SQL based on this batch of columns, using the same conventions as before. You can leave out the word "SELECT" and you can leave out the FROM and WHERE clauses. Just include the lines of the select clause. Leave out any columns that you have chosen to IGNORE.
